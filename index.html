            <h2>1. Water Bottle Taco Holder</h2>
            <p>My idea for the water bottle taco holder is one of the best!  It puts a simple device on the water bottle
                with a simple holder for your taco so the way Taco Tuesdays are now effortless!

            <h2>2. Water Leash</h2>
            <p>This amazing contraption allows your child to enjoy a day at the pool without the stress of them floating 
                away or drowning. A simple vest, leash combo lets your little one splish and splash and you can just give 
                them a tug and wathc them cheerfully drift back!
